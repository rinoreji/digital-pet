## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
	```

	cd digital-pet
	```
2. **Open in Visual Studio or VS Code.**
3. **Build the project:**
	- Using Visual Studio: Press `F5` or click `Build > Build Solution`.
	- Using VS Code: Run the build task or use the terminal:
	  ```
	  dotnet build
	  ```
4. **Run the application:**
	- Using Visual Studio: Press `F5` or click `Debug > Start Debugging`.
	- Using VS Code or terminal:

	  dotnet run
	  ```

## 🕹️ Usage
- The digital pet appears in a small window on your desktop.
- Click the pet to trigger a fun animation.
- Notifications and reminders can be triggered by features (see `FeatureManager`).

## 🧩 Extending the App
- Add new animations: See `AnimationHelper` and `AgentAnimationLoader`.
- Add new sounds: See `SoundPlayerHelper` and `RoverSoundLoader`.
- Add new features: Implement `IAgentFeature` and register with `FeatureManager`.

## 🗂️ Project Structure
Updated (refactored) high-level layout:
- `Views/`: WPF XAML windows (`MainWindow`, `BalloonNotificationWindow`)
- `ViewModels/`: MVVM view models (`MainViewModel`)
- `Models/`: Data models for animations and frames
- `Services/`: Core services (animation, sound, notifications, timers, feature host, UI settings)
- `Features/`: Modular feature implementations (reminder, idle animations, hourly chime)
- `Helpers/`: Transitional helpers (loaders, legacy `AnimationHelper` shim)
- `Assets/`: Images, animation JSON, sound JSON

Legacy `FeatureManager` kept temporarily (marked obsolete) → use `FeatureHost` moving forward.
